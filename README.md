# EPICS Motor Working Group

**discussions** is the repository for the discussions of the EPICS motor working group

The APS is interested in forming a working group to discuss the development of the EPICS motor support.  Occasionally, the group might meet in person, perhaps at an EPICS collaboration meeting. Typically, the EPICS motor working group will meet in the internet using one of the collaboration technologies.
