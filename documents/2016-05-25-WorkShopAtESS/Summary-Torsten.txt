EPICS motion control workshop at ESS,
2016-05-25, 15:45..17:45

> More than 25 participants

> 3 short PPT talks:
  - Mark Rivers,                        EPICS Motor Support
  - Gary Yendell,Observatory Sciences:  EPICS module for PMAC Control
  - Dragutin Maier-Manojlovic:          Experiences with DT PowerBrick at PSI

> 2 PPT-less talks:
  - Steven Hartman, SNS
    SNS moving beamlines to EPICS, mainly Parker 6k.
    Most of their motion they are achieving with/on
    normal network time scales so not sure where the drive for time
    requirements at ESS comes from.

  - Freddie Akeroyd, ISIS
    ISIS using EPICS model 3 Galil driver written by Mark Clift at
    Australian Synchrotron.
    Synchronisation across department borders can be difficult
    e.g. monochrometer and crystal which are controlled by different systems.

> Round table
  - New people getting into EPICS and motion, training needed
  - Some training has been done at DLS from Observatory Science

  - EtherCAT and TwinCAT is used succesfully
    (PSI, STFC Daresbury Lab, ISIS)
     
  - Some people use motorRecord, some not
  - The "model 3 profile move" is not used so often in practice
    as it could be. Mark Rivers is interested in feedback
    how well the API works on other controllers

My conclusion:
  - good to here what others are doing
  - mixture from beginners to highly experienced people
  - good to bring people together
  - Interest for training
  - Forum for EPICS motion needed,
    (Mocraf seems to cover more low level)
