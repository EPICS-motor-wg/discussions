we collected some basic ideas:
- coordinated motion of axis groups
- motion position read back (an array of positions when the movement is done)
- (generic) EPICS insterface for generating trigger pulses at the GPIO at the motion controller
- Re-partition the logic inside the motor record and the driver
- keep EPICS motor record interface to the outside world, so that other applications still
  can work with the motor record.
- Most probably move some code/logic/state machines/code from motorrecord into the driver,
  we may call it model4 driver (if we want)
- We didn't talk about V4, but I think it makes sense
