Motion control WS on Tuesday, 2018-06-11

  - Around 20..25 people attended, I didn't manage to count more precise
  - Niko Kivel @ PSI gave a presentation about the experience
    with the DeltaTau PowerPMAC.
  - Kevein Peterson @ APS talked about splitting the motor module
    into Git submodules.
  - We talked about different ways to control Piezo motors.
    Either with the controller from vendor using TCP/IP or USB.
    Or using an analog output from a motion controller
    which feeds the Piezo controller and closes the loop.
  - Different discussions about amplifiers for piezos,
    which produce less electrical noise than others.
    I didn't record all the details.
  - Some people at PSI want to use the "fully configured"
    motion controller approach:
    The motion controller is configured with all paramaters.
    They are read out by the EPICS IOC from the controller
    and placed in the corresponding motorRecord fields.
    Others don't seem to want that (yet ?)
  - Some reports from PSI that the "STOP" command did not work
    as expected. I am more interested in details & log files.
    Hopefully we can run a test with our patched motorRecord,
    which has some more logging & bug fixes.
  - Status from ESS about improvements and problems with the
    motor module, and another one about the ongoing HW and SW
    standardization efforts.
