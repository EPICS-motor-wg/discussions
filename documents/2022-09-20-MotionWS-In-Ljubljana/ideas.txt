We are planning a Motion Control Workshop as a satellite to the
EPICS collaboration meeting.

We are aiming for a 2 hours session.
Of course, discussions can continue afterwards.

Torsten BÃ¶gershausen will lead the workshop.

What is it about?
Come together, meet people, exchange experiences, learn from each other.

It would be good, if we have an answer to these 3 questions:

  Do you want to give a presentation ?
  - Experiences in general, special controllers, use cases.
  - Planned (or not yet planned) updates/upgrades at you side.
  - Are you using steppers, servos, piezos, other actuators ?
  - Feedback systems ?
  - Coordinated motions ?
  - Connections to "the timing" system ?

  Do you want to have a question to discuss ?

  Do you want to listen only and learn from others.

When I have a better overview, I will compile a better agenda.

Suggestions, questions ?
