Background:

We have currently many production installations
using motorRecord.

A zoo of many different controllers is used.

Changing a single line of code means testing, testing, testing to
make sure that this change does not break anything on a beamline.

On the other hand there is a group of users which need
smaller or bigger code changes and which have the possiblity to
test changes.

We acknowledge that there are 2 user communities.

There is a way forward:

- Short term
  Copy the exiting code from motorRecord from github
  epics-modules/ to epics-motor-wg/
- Rename the motorRecord into axisRecord
- Remove all model1/model2 drivers, with the motivation
  that the device support interface most likely will change
  sooner or later.
- This setup is the base for further development & test
  Once it is mature enough, the new code will be moved
  to epics-modules.
  Model[1|2] may either
   - stay as they are today inside the motor module
   - be re-written as model 3

- How to start
  Today we don't have automateted tests.
  There are some basic tests at SNS and some other at ESS.
  Take the best from these 2 and we will have a basic test suite.
  ESS has a TCP/IP based simulator, which has been used to test different
  drivers. Currently there is even a PR on github/motor.
  After reading it with fresh eyes I think we are nearly there.

- Next steps, first things first:
  - Homing from a limit switch
  - DLY - STOP
  - MRES with modern controllers


Practical details:
- The conversion of motor into axis has started as a prototype,
 https://github.com/EuropeanSpallationSource/motor/tree/160707_motor_becomes_axis

- Automated test scripts needs to be stolen from
  https://github.com/mp49/motor-test
  and
  https://github.com/EuropeanSpallationSource/MCAG_Base_Project/tree/master/epics/test

- The simulator needs to be stolen from
  https://github.com/epics-modules/motor/pull/2
  And other sources, on ESS internal Gits, not on github
