Summary of the motion WS, 2022-09-20
Torsten BÃ¶gershausen, ESS

- 30-40 people participating, majority via zoom
- Seeing new faces, which is good
- Using zoom worked "fully OK" (tm)

- 2 shortened presentations about EtherCAT HW,
    TwinCAT SW and ECMC SW solutions used at
    ESS and collaborating facilities

- Good time for discussions, some highlights:


- functional safety: (There is TwinSAFE, but)
    Personal protection:
      always separate HW:
      switches, cables, safety PLCs (PPS group)
    Machine protection: similar
    Equipment protection: (collision detection)
       probably possible inside the motion controller.
       Use a kill switch: First the limit switch that goes
       into the controller, then the kill switch
       that cuts the power, then comes the wall.

     In any case: Make a hazard analyses:
       - Risk
       - damage
       - impact
       - costs

- Side note:
  The epics motor module has the motorRecord.cc,
  a model3 generic driver and specific drivers for
  each and every vendor/model.
  If not all implementations for different controllers are the same,
  (and motor spend effort to make them uniform):
  I think that those subtle differences in the driver(s)
  should go to tech talk.
  And result in Git patches: PR, MR

- Fly scan with absolute encoders, question from Li Ji
  (No good answers yet)

- Replacement of obsolete deltaTau Turbo PMAC
  (The question came too late for the WS.
   But there are modern controllers ;-)

- Side note: A model 3 driver does allow the usage of
  record(motor, "$(P)$(R)")
  side-by-side with e.g.
  record(ao, "$(P)$(R)-MoveAbs")

- motorRecord is a good abstraction for higher control systems
  The model 3 driver allows the motorRecord to be used.
  caput IOC:m1.VAL (motor Record)
  caput IOC:m1-MoveAbs.VAL (ao record)

  However, you can use callback & wait, to wait for the
  motion to be finished, e.g.
  Move a motor from 6 to 16 mm, 1mm/sec):
  $ time caput -w 20 -c  IOC:m1  16
    Old : IOC:m1                  6
    New : IOC:m1                 16
    real    0m10.476s
  #versus
  $ time caput -w 20 -c  IOC:m1-MoveAbs  16
    Old : IOC:m1-MoveAbs                 6
    New : IOC:m1-MoveAbs                 16
    real    0m0.058s

- What next:
  See you at the next EPICS meeting (hopefully)
  Some follow-up meetings planned to discuss specific item.
